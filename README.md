# Study of Gamma Harmonics in Response to Chromatic Stimuli in Monkey V1
Codes and sample data for Gamma Harmonics Project

Reddish hue induces unusually large gamma in the primate primary visual cortex.
In the spectral analysis, we observed power peaks at harmonics of the fundamental gamma frequency.
Phase relationship between gamma and it's first harmonic explained non-sinusoidal (arch shape) of LFP signal recorded.
We found the inhibition stabilized network (ISN) sub-regimes in which simplified firing rate model produced gamma harmonics.
Phase relationship between simulated gamma and harmonic matched the former experimental observations.
Multiple oscillations (gamma and harmonics) in visual cortex may provide a richer representation of visual stimuli.
